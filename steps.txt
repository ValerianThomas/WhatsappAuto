Write a queue system for message requests
Write an API to login a user and creates messages to send
Write a checker (tests) that make sure all routes are accessible


Queue:
-> create API to:
-> Login in the driver to  a user
-> Detect when a login is done (to remove the qr code and continue with next steps)
-> Start message queue only if user logged in (should start message queue on login)
-> Re-add into the queue message 
-> ChroneJob that send create message requests
-> Interface to login
-> Increase process speed -> if already on a user, don't search for the user again
-> secure the API
- write tests
